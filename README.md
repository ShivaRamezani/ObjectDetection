# Object detection

Resnet algorithm is used to identify objects.
Then openCV is used to identify objects on camera.

â€¢	Developed a machine learning project to detect objects using the Resnet model (Convolutional Neural Network) and ImageNet dataset. Performed preprocessing on the data and utilized OpenCV to identify objects in real-time using the device's camera. Demonstrated proficiency in deep learning and computer vision skills.
